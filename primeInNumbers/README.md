Problem:

Given a positive number n>1 find the prime factor decomposition of n. The result will be a string with the following form:

` "(p1**n1)(p2**n2)...(pk**nk)"`

with the p(i) in increaing order and n(i)empty if n(i)is 1.

Example: ` n = 86240 should return "(2**5)(5)(7**2)(11)" `


What is a prime factor:

A prime factor is a prime number that divids the given number evenly, without leaving a reminder. prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that are divisible only by 1 and themselves. Example `2,3,5,7,11`

What is a prime factor decomposition:

Prime factor decomposition, also know as prime factorization or prime factor representation, refers to the process of expressing a positive integer as a product of its prime factors. In other words, it involves breaking down a number into its prime factors.

The prime factor decomposition represents a number as a product of its prime factors, where each prime factor is raised to a certain exponent. This exponent indicates the number of times the prime factor appears in the decomposition. Example: `60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5`
