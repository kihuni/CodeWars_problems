Here you are required to move the first letter of each word to the end of it, then add "ay" to the end of the word by applying simple rules of pig latin to a given string. Leave punctuation marks untouched.

## Example

```
pig_it('Pig latin is cool') # igPay atinlay siay oolcay
pig_it('Hello world !')     # elloHay orldway !

```
