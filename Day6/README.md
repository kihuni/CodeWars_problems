You are required to convert a string Jaden smith style of capitalization

Example:

```
Not Jaden-Cased: "How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real"
Jaden-Cased:     "How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real"

```

This is how you would [implement it](https://github.com/kihuni/CodeWars_problems/blob/main/Day6/problem6.py)
